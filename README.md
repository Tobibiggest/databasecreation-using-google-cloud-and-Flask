# databasecreation using google cloud and Flask
 Project Overview: Creating a Database for Church Newcomers  TOOLS USED - Google Cloud(Google Doc, SQL), FLASK, QrCode (PYTHON)  IDE - Jupyternotebook and BigQuery.    Introduction:    The project aimed to provide a comprehensive solution for a church seeking to establish a database for their newcomers. The church required a quick and efficient method to collect newcomers' information while simultaneously building a robust database for long-term management and analysis.    Time Frame:    The church requested the creation of a new database for their newcomers with a tight deadline of two days.    Methodology:    1. Temporary Solution with Google Docs and QR Code:    - Initially, a temporary solution was implemented by creating a Google Docs form to collect newcomers' details. This solved the the Church's immediate problem, while also buying me time( three extra days) to create the database more efficiently.    - To streamline the data collection process, the Google Docs link was encrypted and embedded into a QR code.    - Newcomers could conveniently scan the QR code using their smartphones, filling out the form electronically.    - This temporary solution provided a quick and accessible method for collecting newcomer information while buying an additional three days for database development.    2. Database Creation with Google BigQuery and Flask:    - Leveraging Google Cloud Platform's services, a permanent database solution was developed using Google BigQuery.    - A Flask web application was created to serve as the interface for newcomers to input their information.    - The Flask application integrated with Google BigQuery's Python client library to insert the collected data into the database.    3. Implementation and Testing:    - The Flask application and database setup were thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and data integrity.    - Extensive testing was conducted to validate the end-to-end workflow, including data submission, storage, and retrieval.    Conclusion:    In conclusion, the project successfully addressed the church's immediate need for a newcomer database while providing a robust long-term solution. By utilizing a temporary method with Google Docs and QR codes, valuable time was bought to develop a more comprehensive database solution using Google BigQuery and Flask. This approach demonstrates professionalism by adapting to the client's requirements and constraints, ultimately delivering a high-quality solution within the stipulated timeframe.    Key Takeaways:    - Flexibility and adaptability are essential traits in project management, allowing for creative solutions to unforeseen challenges.  - Prioritizing client needs and deadlines while maintaining quality standards is crucial for project success.  - Leveraging cloud-based technologies like Google Cloud Platform can expedite development and deployment processes, enabling efficient solutions for complex requirements.
